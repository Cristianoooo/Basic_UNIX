## Getting Started
The data files required for this workshop are located in a public directory of the instructor’s account. You need to have this in your home directory `(/home/username)` before you start the exercise 1. You can download the compressed directory and extract it by simple commands given below. You will learn about these commands later in the exercise. 
Open the terminal and enter these commands (commands are case sensitive) and each command should be entered in a single line followed by Enter key
```bash
wget http://www.public.iastate.edu/~arnstrm/WORKSHOP_FILES.tar.gz
tar –xvzf WORKSHOP_FILES.tar.gz
```
Once your cursor (command prompt) comes back to the original position, type
```bash
ls 
```
You should see WORKSHOP_FILES listed there.

PS: hand-outs/files are also available for download at https://github.com/ISUgenomics/Basic_UNIX
